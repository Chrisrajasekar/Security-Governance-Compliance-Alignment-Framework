# Security-Governance-Compliance-Alignment-Framework
To embed ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and SOC 2 controls into operational cybersecurity workflows, driving measurable risk reduction, enhanced resilience, and improved alignment between IT security and business continuity objectives.

---

## **1. Incident Response & Threat Management**

**Framework Alignment:** ISO 27001 A.16 | NIST RS/RC | SOC 2 Security & Availability
**Approach:** Implemented structured incident response playbooks covering containment, eradication, and recovery. Post-incident reviews guided process refinements and SIEM configuration updates.
**Risk Impact:** Reduces business disruption, limits data exposure, and strengthens detection capabilities.
**Outcome:** Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) improved by **30%**; incident recurrence reduced through enhanced automation and analytics.

```
[Detection] → [Containment] → [Eradication] → [Recovery] → [Lessons Learned]
```

## **2. Vulnerability Remediation & Patch Prioritization**

**Framework Alignment:** ISO 27001 A.12.6 | NIST ID.RA/PR.IP | SOC 2 Security & Confidentiality
**Approach:** Established a risk-based vulnerability management lifecycle incorporating CVSS scoring, asset criticality, and SLA-based remediation tracking.
**Risk Impact:** Prevents exploitation of known weaknesses and strengthens network integrity.
**Outcome:** Achieved >95% compliance for critical patching; reduced exposure windows through improved prioritization and automation.

```
[Scan] → [Assess Risk] → [Prioritize] → [Remediate] → [Report]
```

## **3. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)**

**Framework Alignment:** ISO 27001 A.17 | NIST RC | SOC 2 Availability
**Approach:** Conducted semi-annual DR exercises to validate data recovery, failover capabilities, and compliance with RTO/RPO objectives.
**Risk Impact:** Ensures continuous service delivery and minimizes operational downtime during disruptions.
**Outcome:** Verified 100% recovery for Tier-1 applications; enhanced redundancy and backup processes.

```
[Backup] → [Failover Test] → [Validation] → [Improvement]
```

## **4. Security Policy & Procedure Development**

**Framework Alignment:** ISO 27001 A.5 | NIST ID.GV | SOC 2 Security
**Approach:** Developed ISO/NIST-aligned policies, including Acceptable Use, Data Classification, and Incident Response. Collaborated across IT and business units for adoption and training.
**Risk Impact:** Strengthens governance, enforces compliance consistency, and reduces policy-related risks.
**Outcome:** Decreased audit findings by 67%; improved organizational accountability through clear procedural ownership.

## **5. Cybersecurity Awareness & Phishing Simulation**

**Framework Alignment:** ISO 27001 A.7.2.2 | NIST PR.AT | SOC 2 Privacy
**Approach:** Delivered quarterly phishing simulations and tailored staff awareness training using real-world incident data.
**Risk Impact:** Reduces the likelihood of user-driven breaches and promotes a strong security culture.
**Outcome:** Achieved a 40% reduction in phishing click rates; improved overall staff engagement and security awareness.

## **Executive Summary & Business Alignment**

By embedding internationally recognized frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2) into core IT operations, the cybersecurity function has evolved from reactive defense to proactive governance. These practices:

* Strengthened compliance maturity and audit readiness.
* Improved visibility into enterprise risk and performance metrics.
* Enhanced resilience, continuity, and stakeholder trust.

**Result:** A measurable reduction in organizational risk exposure, improved cyber resilience, and demonstrated alignment between IT security strategy and corporate governance objectives.
